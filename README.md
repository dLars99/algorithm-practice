# Algorithm Practice

This repo is a collection of answers to exercises
I have worked through as part of my practice with different algorithms. This is purely for my own personal reference and practice purposes.

1. 3sum
There are two variations of the 3sum exercise in this folder. The first, 3sum.js, is from AlgoExpert: find triplets that add up to the target number. The second is a more complex version from LeetCode: find triplets that add to 0, with no duplicate triplets.

2. Binary Search
This is an implementation of the traditional binary search algorithm used to find if a number is a member of an array. File: binarysearch.js.
